# sepomex_api

The purpose of this API is to help developers on their address integrations.

Currently the API returns basic information from postal codes based on the SEPOMEX information, although the API is constantly adding missing postal codes by allowing users to create a request for a new postal code entry.

Also if you don't want to use the service, you can always download all the postal codes in json, csv or xml format. Or integrate a basic version of the API in your server.
